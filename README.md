Experimental GNU APL 1.9 WASM Backend. A lot is taken out (GTK, SQL, Archive). Somehow compiles by divine providence. 

You can test for now with emcmake and runnning `node apl_wasm.js` 
The defualt main file is replaced with me testing the commands until I figure out how to expose `libapl.h` to javascript and change how initialization happens (ignore file reading, etc-etc) 

Credit to Dr. JÃ¼rgen Sauermann and all the contributors to GNU APL. 

Stallman please forgive me for uploading this to Github.
